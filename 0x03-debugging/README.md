0x03. C - Debugging
In this project we are praticing on how to debug programs and what tools to use.

we have four tasks , which are;

0. Multiple mains  - We only need to upload 0-main.c and main.h for this task.

1. Like, comment, subscribe - We copy a given main file. 
                            -  Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

2. 0 > 972? - we create a program that  prints the largest of three integers.

3. Leap year - This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year.
