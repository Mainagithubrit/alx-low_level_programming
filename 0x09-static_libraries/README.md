0x09. C - Static libraries

In this project there are two tasks which are:

0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life - Create the static library

1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future - Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
